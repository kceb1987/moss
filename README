MOSS -- a Mini Operating System Simulator
=========================================


Compiling:

	Use the Makefile -- on Linux, just running "make" is sufficient.
	The main MOSS classes are left in the source directory;  module
	classes (programs and kernel-modules) are left in the modules/
	sub-directory, along with an auto-generated INVENTORY file.

	MOSS can also be compiled and run from within BlueJ, if you
	prefer to develop in that environment, but running from the
	command-line is easier (imo)..


Running:

	"java MiniOSSim" will start the thing up, with the invoking TTY
	(or Java console) being used for the MOSS console.

	When MOSS starts up, it creates a bare-bones file-system at the
	root (/), then reads the modules/INVENTORY file and copies over
	the various classes from the host's file-system into the MOSS
	file-system.  Files will then be found in /bin, /modules and /lib.


Bugs:

	MOSS does not attempt to be perfect, in any way.  There are
	several things missing, some things not wholly implemented and
	probably some just plain broken things.  Patches/etc. gratefully
	accepted :).

	See the accompanying HTML documentation.  The web-page for MOSS
